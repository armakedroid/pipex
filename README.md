# 🛠️ Pipex
*Explore UNIX pipes by implementing them in C*

---

## 📘 Overview
The **Pipex** project allows you to dive deep into UNIX mechanisms you already know, specifically **pipes**.  
You will implement a program that behaves like shell commands using `<`, `|`, and `>` operators.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how UNIX pipes work.
- Learn to manage file descriptors.
- Handle processes and system calls (`fork`, `execve`, `dup2`, `pipe`).
- Handle errors and memory management properly.
- Implement bonus features like multiple pipes and here_doc.
